# Weather-CLI-App

###### API-assignment

Below are the instructions of the API assignment:

* You are tasked with developing and designing a small application of any kind that incorporates the use of APIs.
* You can edit and use the website that you develop in Front-End Web development (As a bonus).
* The focus of this assignment is on how you will use external APIs to fetch and display relevant data in your app.
* It is important to read the documentation of each api you will use (e.g. endpoints, how to access APIs keys, etc.)
* You are expected to refer to the following external APIs in developing the web application:
https://rapidapi.com/categoriesLinks to an external site.
* Or any sources you prefer (Be careful to vet the public APIs you use as some might be malicious)
* You will focus on using external APIs (e.g., APIs for travel, entertainment, etc.) and extending the functionality of your application by making use of a public API of your choice
* The application you come up with should be useful and not gimmicky (i.e. focus should be on functionality, not bells and whistles like crazy and over the top UI. A CLI app is also acceptable) 
* You should also display the data in an easy-to-use and understand format (e.g. statistical data, etc.) and let the user interact with the data you provided (e.g. sort, etc.)
* Along with your GitHub link to the app you make, upload a small demo of a 2 min video showing us how to use your app

## Weather CLI App purpose
